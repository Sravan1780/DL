1. Broadcast Semantics (From Scratch to Advanced)
    1.1 What is Broadcasting?
        Broadcasting allows two tensors of different shapes to be operated together without manually reshaping them. Instead of repeating data manually, PyTorch automatically expands one or both tensors to match their shapes.

    1.2 Why is Broadcasting Needed?
        Imagine we have:
        A big matrix of values.
        A small vector that we want to apply to every row of that matrix.
    Instead of manually duplicating the small vector to match the matrix, broadcasting does it automatically.

2. Basic Broadcasting Rules
    For two tensors to be broadcastable, the following rules must be followed:
    If two tensors have different ranks (number of dimensions), the smaller one is padded (on the left) with 1s.
    Then, for each dimension (starting from the rightmost):
    If the sizes are equal, they are compatible.
    If one of them is 1, it gets expanded to match the other.
    Otherwise, they are incompatible, and broadcasting fails.

3. Basic Examples (Step by Step)
    3.1 Case 1: Same Shape (No Broadcasting)
    If the tensors already have the same shape, no broadcasting happens.
        import torch
        A = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], 
                        [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: [2, 3]
        B = torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30], 
                        [40, 50, 60]])  # Shape: [2, 3]
        C = A + B  # No broadcasting needed
        print(C)
        ‚úÖ Output:
        tensor([[11, 22, 33],
                [44, 55, 66]])

    3.2 Case 2: Broadcasting a Smaller Tensor
    Now, let's say B is a 1D vector, and we want to add it to A:
        A = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], 
                        [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: [2, 3]

        B = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30])  # Shape: [3]

        C = A + B  # Broadcasting happens
        print(C)
        üîç What happens?

        B has shape [3], but A has shape **[2, 3]`.

        PyTorch automatically expands B to [2, 3] by copying it for each row.

        ‚úÖ Output:
        tensor([[11, 22, 33],
                [14, 25, 36]])
    3.3 Case 3: Expanding Along an Axis
        Now, let‚Äôs try adding a column vector to a matrix.
        A = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], 
                        [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: [2, 3]
        B = torch.tensor([[10], 
                        [20]])  # Shape: [2, 1]
        C = A + B  # Broadcasting happens
        print(C)
        üîç What happens?

        B has shape [2,1] but A has shape **[2,3]`.

        PyTorch automatically expands B to [2,3].

        ‚úÖ Output:
        tensor([[11, 12, 13],
                [24, 25, 26]])
    3.4 Case 4: Expanding Both Tensors
        Now, let‚Äôs add a single number (scalar) to a matrix.
        A = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], 
                        [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: [2, 3]
        B = torch.tensor(10)  # Shape: []
        C = A + B  # Broadcasting happens
        print(C)
        üîç What happens?

        B is a scalar (shape []).

        PyTorch expands B to match the shape [2,3].

        ‚úÖ Output:
        tensor([[11, 12, 13],
                [14, 15, 16]])
4. Advanced Broadcasting Example
    Let‚Äôs apply broadcasting in matrix multiplication.

    A = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)  # Shape: [2, 3, 4]
    B = torch.randn(4)        # Shape: [4]

    C = A * B  # Broadcasting happens
    print(C.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([2, 3, 4])

    üîç What happens?
    B has shape [4].
    PyTorch expands B to [2,3,4].
    Element-wise multiplication is performed.

5. keepdims in Reduction Operations
    5.1 What is keepdims?
    When performing sum, mean, max, etc., along a dimension, we can keep or remove the reduced dimension using keepdims=True or keepdims=False.

6. Examples of keepdims
    6.1 Without keepdims (Default)
        A = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], 
                        [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape: [2, 3]

        sum_A = torch.sum(A, dim=1)  # Sum along axis 1 (rows)
        print(sum_A.shape)  # Shape: [2]
        print(sum_A)
        ‚úÖ Output:
        tensor([ 6, 15])  # Shape [2]
        üîç What happened?

        The columns (dim=1) were summed, and their dimension was removed.

    6.2 With keepdims=True
        sum_A = torch.sum(A, dim=1, keepdim=True)  # Keep the reduced dimension
        print(sum_A.shape)  # Shape: [2, 1]
        print(sum_A)
        ‚úÖ Output:
        tensor([[ 6],
                [15]])  # Shape [2,1]
        üîç What happened?

        The columns (dim=1) were summed, but their dimension was kept (size 1 instead of removed).

    6.3 Why is keepdims=True Useful?
        Maintains Shape Consistency: Keeps the same rank (number of dimensions) in multi-step calculations
        Prevents Shape Mismatch Errors: Some operations require dimensions to match exactly.
        For example:
        A = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], 
                        [4, 5, 6]])

        mean_A = torch.mean(A, dim=1, keepdim=True)  # Shape [2,1]

        # Subtracting mean from A without broadcasting issues
        normalized_A = A - mean_A
        print(normalized_A)
7. Conclusion
